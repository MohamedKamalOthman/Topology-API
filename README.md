# Topology-API
## Why I used Java:
- Its Object Oriented obviously.
- It has a wide coummunity and easier to add libraries and unit test APIs.
- support build tools like Maven and Gradle.
- Its platform-independent.
- I am learning Java at the moment so I thought it would be a good challenge for me
## Info
- JDK is openjdk-17 Oracle OpenJDK.
- Maven is used to build and add dependencies.
- API and all code tested using junit.
- Code analyzed using SolarLint.
- Documented using Javadoc.
